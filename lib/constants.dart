  "By connecting people with similar medical problems through our app, they as a community would be able to discuss problems, find solutions, motivate each other and most importantly cheer each other up, resulting in a happy community.",
  "Our idea is to fill gap between medical treatment and the need for emotional support. A person's relationship with a doctor or other medical personnel may not provide adequate emotional support, and a person's family and friends may not understand the impact of a disease or treatment. So this app may function as a bridge between medical and emotional needs.",
  "In the times like covid where people can not go out for a meet in support group, this website really solves majority of problems. This provides a more widespread reach as people arenâ€™t just restricted to connect with the people only living near them",
