# unite_to_heal_project

A Flutter project.

The idea is to fill gap between medical treatment and the need for emotional support. A person's relationship with a doctor or other medical personnel may not provide adequate emotional support, and a person's family and friends may not understand the impact of a disease or treatment. So the app where people can share their respective experiences may function as a bridge between medical and emotional needs.
